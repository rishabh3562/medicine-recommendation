### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-folder
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Ensure you create the virtual environment in the same hierarchy as `requirements.txt`.

```bash
python -m venv venv  # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
First, try installing all dependencies at once:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If this does not work, install the dependencies manually:
```bash
pip install flask
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2  # Required version for model compatibility
```
_**Note:** The model is trained on scikit-learn 1.3.2, so please use this version only._

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### 5. Deactivate Virtual Environment (Optional)
When you're done using the project:
```bash
deactivate
```
